# ✅ Final Smart Contract Pre Audit – SwapV2 API and Contract

Project: ToshibaSwap
Contract Name: SwapWithFee
Author: InHaus Web3 Development

## 🔍 Overview

The SwapWithFee contract is a flexible and secure UniswapV2-compatible swap router wrapper that:

* Supports ERC-20 and ETH-based swaps.
* Implements tiered fee logic based on NFT ownership.
* Supports gasless permit-based swaps via EIP-2612.
* Unwraps WETH to ETH when the final token is WETH (UX-friendly).
* Emits granular swap execution events for tracking and analytics.

| 🛡️ Permit Front-Running               | ✅ Restricted to approved relayer via isRelayer[msg.sender]  |
| 🧱 Hardcoded Toshiba Token             | ✅ Replaced with mutable setToshibaToken()                     |
| 🧾 Missing setFeeRecipient()         | ✅ Added with event logging                                      |
| 🪙 Unsafe approve() pattern          | ✅ Replaced with safeIncreaseAllowance() using OpenZeppelin    |
| 📊 Swap output tracking missing        | ✅ SwapExecuted now emits exact token deltas                   |
| 🧠 Missing permit expiry validation    | ✅ Permit deadline capped to 24 hours with MAX_PERMIT_DURATION |
| 🧠 Native ETH delivery from WETH swaps | ✅ WETH is unwrapped and sent to user in _erc20Flow()          |

## 🔐 Security Review

### ✅ Strengths

* Access Control: All config changes are gated via onlyOwner.
* ETH Handling: receive() function is defined; call{value} used with proper checks.
* Reentrancy Safe: ETH sent after state changes; no external callback targets.
* Permit Security: Gasless flow is whitelisted, capped to 24h permit window.
* SafeERC20: All ERC-20 actions use SafeERC20 to protect against broken ERC-20s like USDT.

### 🔵 Low Risk (Informational)

| Risk                          | Detail                                                                                                              | Recommendation                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⏱ Permit clock skew edge case | Permit deadline may be set close to block.timestamp + MAX_PERMIT_DURATION, depending on relayer/client clock sync | Safe, but ensure frontends submit slightly under the cap |

| Feature               | Notes                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fee tiers             | Based on admin NFT, employee NFT, and token type (Toshiba vs WETH)     |
| Gasless swap          | Supported with EIP-2612 permit, relayer gating, max deadline           |
| ETH unwrapping        | Contract unwraps WETH and transfers ETH to user when needed            |
| Analytics integration | SwapExecuted logs all swaps with input/output amounts clearly        |
| Modular struct use    | ERC20Swap and ETHSwap keep function params clean and gas efficient |
| Upgradeability        | ❌ Not upgradeable, but no external storage dependency issues           |

## 🧪 Test Coverage Recommendations

A complete test suite should include:

| Scenario          | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✅ ERC-20 swap     | With standard token (e.g., DAI)       |
| ✅ ERC-20 FOT swap | With token like SHIB or SAFEMOON      |
| ✅ ETH swap        | With and without fee tiers            |
| ✅ Gasless swap    | With valid permit() and isRelayer |
| ✅ Fee exemptions  | Admin NFT holders get 0% fee          |
| ✅ Fee calculation | Toshiba token vs standard fee logic   |
| ✅ ETH unwrapping  | User receives ETH, not WETH           |
